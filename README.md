# Final-Year-Project


Welcome to my repository!


I am a final year Digital Humanities & Information Technolgoy student conducting a final year project about Formula One. My research question focuses on technology's impact on both vehicle performance and driver safety from 1950 to the present. This repository I have created includes data I have gathered and collected myself along with other datasets that I have imported from Kaggle. The aim of this repository is to gain an a better understanding of technology's impact on both vehicle performance and driver safety over time according to the data I am using. I am using Google Colab and using the programming language Python to understand this data better.


# Take a look at my data and findings here:

The aim of this research and analysis is to further improve my understanding of the impact of technological evolution on vehicle performance and driver safety in Formula 1. The goal of this is to highlight key areas that have contributed to improving both of these fields in Formula 1. This data will provide new insights that will contribute to my research project.
