# Final-Year-Project

Welcome to my repository!

I am a final year Digital Humanities & Information Technolgoy student conducting a final year project about Formula One. My research question focuses on technology's impact on both vehicle performance and driver safety from 1950 to the present. This repository I have created includes data I have gathered and collected myself along with other datasets that I have imported from Kaggle. The aim of this repository is to gain an a better understanding of technology's impatc on both vehicle performance and driver safety over time according to the data I am using. 

I am using Google Colab and using the programming language Python to understand this data better.

Firstly I will focus on technology's impact on vehicle performance from 1950 to the present:
